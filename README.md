## Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic expressions are mathematical expressions that involve numbers and operators such as +, -, *, /, and %.

### Examples:

In Python, you can perform arithmetic operations using the following operators:

- Addition: +
- Subtraction: -
- Multiplication: *
- Division: /
- Modulus: %

Let's try some examples:

```python
x = 10
y = 5
z = x * y
print(z)
